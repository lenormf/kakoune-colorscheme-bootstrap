kakoune-colorscheme-bootstrap
-----------------------------

Creating or porting a color scheme to
https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/[Kakoune] can be a tedious process,
as it generally involves copying RGB values from one file to another,
and converting names from one syntax to another.

This repository aims at providing a starting point to users who want to
use their favorite color scheme in Kakoune, or create a new one based on
an already established palette (e.g. `zenburn`).

How to use the files in the `themes` directory?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `themes` directory contains `.kak` files that declare faces with the
proper colors already set for the theme they implement. The usual code token
such as keywords, numbers, comments etc should already be handled by those
files, as well as the background color, foreground color (for generic text)
or line numbers.

Copy the theme you're interested in, then modify it to implement the missing
faces that are specific to Kakoune (menus, selections etc).

How were the bootstrap themes generated?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `generate.py` script was used to parse all the themes provided by
the http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.php[highlight]
utility, and generate color schemes usable in Kakoune.
